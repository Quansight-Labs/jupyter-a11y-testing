# Testing - Jupyter Accessibility

## ðŸš§ WIP - Work in Progress

This directory is a place for accessibility testing within [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).

> **Note:** > **As of May 10, 2022, it is a very early work in progress.**

## Plans for the future

Automated accessibility tests cannot address accessibility issues on their own,
but used correctly they can be a useful tool.

This directory is modeled after the [JupyterLab Benchmarks](https://github.com/jupyterlab/benchmarks/) repo.

As described in the [Jupyter Accessibility Roadmap](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/blob/main/docs/funding/czi-grant-roadmap.md),
the plan is to start with JupyterLab.
We are starting with the web app UI, then we will add tests for the docs. (The rationale to that sequence is to start with
the harder problem first.)

After JupyterLab, though it is not within scope of the grant driving the
roadmap, we hope to extend this testing to other parts of the Jupyter ecosystem
beyond JupyterLab.
