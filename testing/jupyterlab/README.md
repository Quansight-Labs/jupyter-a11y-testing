## Requirements üì¶

To run the tests in this directory you need the following prerequisites:

1. [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) (or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/install.html))
1. Your system must also meet the [Playwright system requirements](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#system-requirements)

## Running the accessibility tests ‚úÖ

You can run tests locally on your machine, or remotely in the cloud.

At the time of this writing, we have configured the tests to only run with Chromium,
but you can [extend these tests to cover other browsers](https://github.com/MarcusFelling/demo.playwright/blob/main/accessibility/playwright.config.ts)
by modifying the [`playwright.config.ts`](testing/jupyterlab/playwright.config.ts) file.

### Running the tests locally üíª

1. Make sure you are in the correct directory - the one containing the `playwright.config.ts` file:

   ```bash
   cd testing/
   ```

2. Install Node.js and the needed Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   # if using conda
   conda env create -f environment.yml

   # if using mamba
   mamba env create -f environment.yml
   ```

3. Activate the new conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate a11y-tests
   ```

4. Install the Node.js dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npx playwright install
   ```

5. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   # For JupyterLab tests
   npm test --project jupyterlab
   ```

Your console should output a local URL that you can open in your browser to see
the test results: typically <http://127.0.0.1:9323>

### Running the tests in Gitpod ‚òÅÔ∏è

As an alternative to running the tests locally on your own machine, you can run
them in a cloud environment on Gitpod.

[![Open in Gitpod button](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility)

1. Once you are in the Gitpod workspace you'll need to make sure you are in the correct directory - the one containing the `playwright.config.ts` file:

   ```bash
   cd testing/jupyterlab
   ```

1. Now you can run the tests from the command line:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

The Gitpod console should output a local URL that you can open in your browser
to see the test results: typically <http://127.0.0.1:9323>

In case you're wondering how you can open a local URL from a cloud environment,
Gitpod opens a remote session in VS Code (or other supported editor) and sets it
up to proxy the local URL to its remote server address.

> **Warning**
> Currently our Gitpod setup does not allow you to debug playwright tests by opening additional browser tabs.

## Troubleshooting üîç

If a test fails, Playwright should attach a video and possibly other files to
that test, which could help debug or explain why the test failed.
