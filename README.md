Welcome to the Jupyter Accessibility testing tool's repository. üëãüèΩ
This repository is a place for accessibility testing within [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).

To learn more about the broader accessibility initiatives within Jupyter, check the [jupyter/accessibility repository][jupyter-accesibility].

> **Note**
> üóÉ The JupyterLab tests and the corresponding instructions to run these can be found in [testing/jupyterlab](testing/jupyterlab).

## Plans for the future

Automated accessibility tests cannot address accessibility issues on their own, but used correctly they can be a useful tool.

Work in this repository is modeled after the [JupyterLab Benchmarks](https://github.com/jupyterlab/benchmarks/) repo.

As described in the [Jupyter Accessibility Roadmap](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/blob/main/docs/funding/czi-grant-roadmap.md),
the plan is to start by adding tests for JupyterLab.
We are starting with the web app UI, then we will add tests for the docs.
(The rationale for that sequence is to start with the harder problem first.)

After JupyterLab, though it is not within the scope of the grant driving the roadmap,
we hope to extend this testing to other parts of the Jupyter ecosystem beyond JupyterLab.

## Pre-commit hooks üßπ

This repository uses the `prettier` [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/) to standardize our YAML and markdown structure.

1. Before you can run the hooks, you need to install the pre-commit package manager:

   ```bash
   # using pip
   pip install pre-commit

   # if you prefer using conda
   conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
   ```

2. From the root of this project, install the git hook scripts:

   ```bash
   # install the pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. Optional- run the hooks against the files in this repository

   ```bash
   # run the pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

Once installed, the pre-commit hooks will run automatically when you make a commit in version control.
