Welcome to the Jupyter accessibility testing tools repository üëãüèΩ .

## üßπ Pre-commit hooks

This repository uses the `prettier` [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/) to standardize our YAML and markdown structure.

1. Before you can run the hooks, you need to install the pre-commit package manager:

   ```bash
   # using pip
   pip install pre-commit

   # if you prefer using conda
   conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
   ```

2. From the root of this project, install the git hook scripts:

   ```bash
   # install the pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. Optional- run the hooks against the files in this repository

   ```bash
   # run the pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

Once installed, the pre-commit hooks will run automatically when you make a commit in version control.
